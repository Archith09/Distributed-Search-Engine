Instructions to run crawler on EC2
- Create a .jar file for the Distributed Crawler Master (final-master-crawler.jar)
- Create a .jar file for the Distributed Crawler Worker

Node requirements for Crawler:
- sudo yum update 
- sudo yum install java-1.8.0
- sudo yum remove java-1.7.0-openjdk

Uploading a jar
rsync -azv --progress -e "ssh -i private.pem" path_to_jar.jar public_ipv:.

Connecting to EC2
sudo ssh -i "/home/.aws/credentials/private.pem" public_ipv



Running master node
- java -jar final-master-crawler.jar masterport worker1IP:port worker2IP:port worker2IP:port

Running worker node
-  Worker: java -Xms512m -Xmx1024m -Xss512k -jar crawler.jar seedURL path_to_db download_limit page_size crawler_thread back_host_queue storage_thread push_interval crawler_delay S3bucket node

Indexer:
Edit the arraylist in edu.upenn.cis455.configuration.Constants class to include the worker address 

Master - to upload master jar for indexer
Make final-master-indexer.jar by making the project using edu.upenn.cis455.master.Master as main class 
rsync -azv --progress -e "ssh -i /home/cis455/.ec2/login.pem" /home/cis455/workspace/final-master-indexer.jar ec2-user@ec2-54-173-32-226.compute-1.amazonaws.com:.

Worker - to upload indexer worker jar (NOTE you will have to upload this jar to 15 workers in the distributed cluster) 
Make final-worker-indexer-backup.jar by making the project using edu.upenn.cis455.master.Worker as main class
rsync -azv --progress -e "ssh -i /home/cis455/.ec2/login.pem" /home/cis455/workspace/final-worker-indexer-backup.jar ec2-user@ec2-54-204-182-74.compute-1.amazonaws.com:.

Run the master jar using the below command
java -jar final-master-indexer.jar 8000
8000 is port number here

Run the worker jar using the below command
java -Xms512m -Xmx8000m -Xss512k -jar final-worker-indexer-backup.jar <master IP+Port> <worker number> <worker IP+Port> <input file> <main output db> <backup output db> 32 1000 5000 1 5


SEARCH ENGINE INSTRUCTIONS
Requirements:
- Install Tomcat 7.0.21
- java.1.8.0

Instruction to run search engine on EC2
- Create a .war file for the search engine code
- Upload war using the following command:
	- scp -i /home/.aws/private.pem path_to_war_file root@INSTANCE_PUBLIC_DNS_NAME:/env/tomcat/apache-tomcat-7.0.77/webapps/name_of_war.war
	
- On EC2 terminal execute the following code:
	- mv webapps/ROOT webapps/xROOT
	- ./bin/startup.sh (to run tomcat)
	- ./bin/shutdown.sh (to run tomcat)
	- 
- Go to browser and type in the public key for the EC2 machine with the Tomcat port number and the required project path (Make sure the web.xml is edited appropriately)
